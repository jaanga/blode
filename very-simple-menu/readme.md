## Concept
Provide sample code for a very simple two panel menu and content system where both the menu are called from external HTML files at runtime.


## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the files in the Jaanga repositories:  

* Web page hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/blode/very-simple-menu "view the files as apps." )  <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/blode/tree/gh-pages/very-simple-menu "View the files as source code." )  <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>
