Run the demo: [ Very Simple Menu]( http://jaanga.github.io/blode/very-simple-menu/r1/index.html )

### Concept
Provide sample code for a very simple two panel menu and content system where both the menu and content files are called from external HTML files at runtime.

### Features

* Reads 'menu.html' and displays it as HTML in the left side menu panel
* Menu file may contain links to any number of HTML files that display in right side content panel
* Designed to be 'as simple as possible, but not too simple.'
* See the blog post: [Very Simple Menu R1]( http://www.jaanga.com/2014/02/very-simple-menu-r1.html )


### Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the files in the Jaanga repositories:  

* Web page hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/blode/very-simple-menu "view the files as apps." )  <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/blode/tree/gh-pages/very-simple-menu "View the files as source code." )  <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>

### Notes

The HTML and the CSS are created using JavaScript. Writing in one language is simpler than writing in three languages.

The code is generous horizontally and stingy vertically. Most monitors are more wide than high.

Stye sheet items are in alphabetical order. Is there a better order?
